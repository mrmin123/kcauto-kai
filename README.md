# kcauto

**kcauto** (previously called kcauto-kai) is a robust Kantai Collection automation tool. kcauto and it's predecessor, [kancolle-auto](https://github.com/mrmin123/kancolle-auto), are proof-of-concepts in using [Sikuli](http://sikulix.com/) for vision-based automation to play Kantai Collection. They are exercises in automating large, convoluted, and complex game-playing logic. The primary logic of kcauto is written in Jython 2.7, with a standalone browser interface for config generation written in React JavaScript.

kcauto is not designed to be the fastest automation tool, but is instead robust, highly customizable, and relatively safe to use. Please read the Disclaimer below before use!

### Prerequisites

* Game is scaled to 100% size/1x scaling &mdash; the entire game should be 1200 pixels wide and 720 pixels tall if you take a screenshot of it
* Turn off any browser/viewer features that obscure the game (e.g. subtitles) &mdash; these can keep kcauto from properly operating. Subtitles specifically can block the damage states of ships during combat, which may lead to loss of ships due to hampered damage detection. At the very least, lower the subtitles' font size

### Installation and Usage

1. Install [Java JRE 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
2. Install [SikuliX 1.1.3](https://launchpad.net/sikuli/sikulix/1.1.3) with option 1 (Pack 1) selected
3. Download kcauto either by downloading the repo or cloning it
4. Set up kcauto's config file using the [web interface](https://mrmin123.github.io/kcauto/) or by opening the local copy of `docs/index.html` in a browser
    * Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/mrmin123/kcauto/wiki/Configuration#config-file) for a detailed explanation of each of the config fields
5. Run Kantai Collection in your favorite browser or viewer
6. Run kcauto using the command `java -jar <path_to_sikuli>/sikulix.jar -r <path_to_kcauto>/kcauto.sikuli` (replacing `<path_to_sikuli>` and `<path_to_kcauto>` with the correct directories for your installs); you can also use the [RunCmd tab](https://mrmin123.github.io/kcauto/#runcmd) of the web interface to help generate the command

Users not comfortable with the command line and looking for a GUI solution can use [KAGA](https://github.com/waicool20/KAGA) to both create the config and run kcauto. Please note that KAGA is not developed by the developer of kcauto, and there may be times when KAGA is not compatible with the latest version of kcauto.

### Updating

The preferred method of keeping kcauto up to date is via git. This requires you have a working [git](https://git-scm.com/) installation, have cloned the kcauto repository, and are running kcauto off of said clone.

If you do have git and cloned the kcauto repository, use one of the following command to update to the latest release (`master` version) of kcauto:

* `git pull origin master` or `git pull`

If you do not have git but would still like to keep up with `master`, please use [this guide](https://github.com/KC3Kai/KC3Kai/wiki/Setup-development-build) for setting up tortoisegit, but with the clone URL changed to `https://github.com/mrmin123/kcauto.git`

If you do not have git, tortoisegit, or a clone of the kcauto repository, head to the [Releases page](https://github.com/mrmin123/kcauto/releases) and download the latest tagged version. Overwrite your local kcauto installation with the contents of the new release, taking care to first back up or not overwrite your config file. Note that your config file may need updating to be compatible with new releases.
